This code section/package is designed to monitor an NGINX log file, parse its entries, and send the parsed data to a WebSocket server in real-time. 

### LogEntry Class
- **Purpose**: Represents a single log entry with an IP address and a project name.
- **Fields**:
 - `ipAddress`: The IP address associated with the log entry.
 - `project`: The project name extracted from the log entry.
- **Constructor**: Takes an IP address and a project name as parameters and initializes the fields.
- **Getters**: Provides methods to retrieve the IP address and project name.

### LogMonitor Class
- **Purpose**: Monitors a specified log file for changes and processes new or modified entries.
- **Fields**:
 - `logPath`: The path to the log file being monitored.
 - `watchService`: A service that watches for changes in the log file.
 - `logParser`: An instance of `LogParser` used to parse log entries.
 - `webSocketClient`: An instance of `WebSocketClient` used to send parsed log entries to a WebSocket server.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the fields, sets up the watch service to monitor the log file for modifications, and registers the log file with the watch service.
- **monitor() Method**: Continuously checks for modifications in the log file. When a modification is detected, it processes the modified log file.
- **processModifiedLogFile() Method**: Reads the modified log file, parses each line into a `LogEntry` object, and sends the entry to the WebSocket server if it's not null.
- **sendToWebSocket() Method**: Sends a `LogEntry` object to the WebSocket server.

### LogParser Class
- **Purpose**: Parses log lines to extract relevant information (IP address and project name) using a regular expression.
- **Field**:
 - `LOG_PATTERN`: A compiled regular expression pattern for matching log lines.
- **parse() Method**: Takes a log line as input, applies the regular expression to find matches, and extracts the IP address and project name. Returns a `LogEntry` object if a match is found, or null otherwise.

### NginxLogTailer Class
- **Purpose**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the `LogParser`, `WebSocketClient`, and `LogMonitor`, and starts the log monitoring process.
- **Main Method**:
 - Creates instances of `LogParser` and `WebSocketClient`.
 - Initializes `LogMonitor` with the log file path, `LogParser`, and `WebSocketClient`.
 - Calls the `monitor()` method of `LogMonitor` to start monitoring the log file.

### WebSocketClient Class
- **Purpose**: Establishes a WebSocket connection to a server and sends log entries to it.
- **Fields**:
 - `webSocket`: The WebSocket connection.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the `webSocket` field by creating a WebSocket connection to the specified URI.
- **sendLogEntry() Method**: Sends a `LogEntry` object to the WebSocket server.
- **close() Method**: Closes the WebSocket connection.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The `NginxLogTailer` class initializes the `LogParser`, `WebSocketClient`, and `LogMonitor` with the necessary configurations.
2. **Monitoring**: The `LogMonitor` continuously watches the specified log file for modifications.
3. **Parsing**: When a modification is detected, it reads the modified lines, parses them using `LogParser`, and extracts `LogEntry` objects.
4. **Sending**: The parsed `LogEntry` objects are sent to the WebSocket server using the `WebSocketClient`.

This system allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of NGINX log files by sending parsed log entries to a WebSocket server, enabling dynamic log processing and analysis.
